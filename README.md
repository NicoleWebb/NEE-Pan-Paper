# NEE-Pan-Paper

This repository contains the code to showcase the various analyses executed in a study currently under consideration for publication. 

Usage Notes:

-The purpose of this repository is primarily for reproducibility and to show interested third parties the details of the conducted analyses and their associated visualizations.

-Some of the R and matlab scripts may occasionally contain references to .ply and .csvs files that are too large to conveiently share within this respository; however, they will happily be made available if a formal request is sent to nicole.webb@senckenberg.de

-Owing to data-sharing agreements, it is not possible to share all of the raw scan images used in the study.
